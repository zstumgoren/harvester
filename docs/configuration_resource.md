App-level Configuration
=======================

AP Harvester allows for some optional app-level configuration through
a configuration sheet. If you deploy the app with the environment variable
`HARVESTER_CONFIG_RESOURCE_ID` set to [the spreadsheet ID of a Google
Sheet][google-spreadsheet-id] then Harvester will use that sheet as its app
configuration.

To set up a configuration sheet you can [create a new Google
Sheet](https://sheets.new), name it something you'll remember (like "Harvester
Config"), rename the first tab from "Sheet1" to "forms", and put the strings
`slug` and `form_id` in cells `A1` and `B1`, respectively; finally, you'll have
to share the sheet with your Harvester service account (remember you might want
to uncheck "Notify people").

## Custom Form URLs

The app configuration sheet allows you to set up custom form URLs in order to
get a more human-readable link to share with data collectors. If the config
sheet has a tab named `forms` that contains the columns `slug` and `form_id`
then you can access the form specified by the sheet with ID `form_id` at the URL

```shell
/forms/<slug>
```

For example, if the `forms` tab looks like this:

| slug    | form_id                            |
|:--------|:-----------------------------------|
| my-form | 1em6MB9S_tL2K2zoPVx9PQ128xrVft9SpT |

then the following paths will be equivalent:

```shell
/forms/my-form
/d/1em6MB9S_tL2K2zoPVx9PQ128xrVft9SpT
```

The former (`/forms/my-form`) will be treated as canonical, meaning Harvester
will redirect users from the latter with a `301` to the former.

## Limiting Allowed Resources

By default Harvester is not picky about the resources it uses to render forms.
Anyone can create a Google Sheet, set it up correctly, share it with your
service account, and be off to the races. Depending on how you deploy it, you
may want to lock down your Harvester a little more tightly.

You can add a tab called `allowlist` to your configuration sheet; the allowlist
specifies resources without custom URLs that Harvester is allowed to use.
(Resources with custom URLs are automatically allowed.) A basic `allowlist`
might allow use of a resource with the ID `1em6MB9S_tL2K2zoPVx9PQ128xrVft9SpT`
like so:

| form_id                            |
|:-----------------------------------|
| 1em6MB9S_tL2K2zoPVx9PQ128xrVft9SpT |

With that configuration, Harvester will allow access to anything with a custom
URL at the correct `/forms` endpoint _and_ it this particular resource at
`/d/1em6MB9S_tL2K2zoPVx9PQ128xrVft9SpT`. Note that if this resource is _also_
given a custom URL then including it in the `allowlist` will have no effect;
users will still be forwarded to `/forms/<slug>` like normal.

A typical use case for the `allowlist` configuration is to create the
`allowlist` tab and leave it blank. If your `allowlist` is empty, Harvester
_only_ renders forms with custom URLs in the `forms` tab.

The advantage of using an `allowlist` is that it lets you restrict who can
create new Harvester projects by restricting access to the configuration sheet
itself. No new Harvester projects can be started without first adding them to
the configuration sheet, either as a custom URL or as an entry in the
`allowlist`.
